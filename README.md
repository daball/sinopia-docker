# Sinopia

A private/caching npm repository server configuration for Docker.

## Design Considerations

- Relies upon official Node.js Docker container
- Version locking when possible
- Runs as an unprivileged user
- Installs and runs Sinopia

## Using this Dockerfile (by cloning this repo)

You can use all the defaults by typing:

    `git clone https://github.com/daball/sinopia-docker`
    `
